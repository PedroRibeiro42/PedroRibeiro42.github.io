  <h1 class="center">Evaluation</h1>
  
<div id="section">

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Your grade is divided into 3 components:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Homeworks <font color="brown">(30%)</font></b>
      <li><b>Test <font color="brown">(30%)</font></b>
      <li><b>Project <font color="brown">(40%)</font></b>
    </ul>

<p>There are no minimum grades in any of the evaluation components, but failure to present any of the deliverables (homeworks, test and project) will result on a <i>RFF</i> evaluation (the student essentially did not participate on the course) and failure to present the project will result on a <i>RFC</i> evaluation (missing a component).</p>

</div>

<div id="section">
  <h2>Homeworks and Test</h2>
  
  <p><b>Homeworks:</b> group (2 or 3 persons) homeworks (with around 2 weeks
for each) to be delivered by email. You will apply some concepts in
    practice (potentially using a computer to analyze small datasets).</p>

<p><b>Test:</b> one individual test (pen and paper) to be done "on site"
during monday class with a duration of 2h30m</p>

  <p><b>Tentative Dates:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="homework/homework1.pdf">1st Homework</a> <b>(15%)</b> <i>(available: 18/03 | due: <strike>04/04</strike> 07/04)</i>
    <li><a>2nd Homework</a> <b>(15%)</b> <i>(predicted to be made available in April)</i>
    <li><a>Test</a> <b>(30%)</b> <i>(predicted to be made in May)</i></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Project</h2>

<p>
  <b>Type:</b> group (2 or 3 persons)<br>
  <b>Limit for project delivery (article):</b>  <i>(predicted to be near the end of June)</i> <br>

<p>Students will need to present the following deliverables:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Written article:</b> 6 to 10 pages (using <a href="http://www.kdd.org/author-instructions">KDD double column format</a>).
    <li><b>Presentation:</b> 15 minutes, describing the work done
  </ul>

<p>The basic idea is for you to work on a small scale project in which you will analyze a network dataset using the concepts you learned in the course.

<p>You could either use already existing datasets, or create a new one (see the <a href="links.html">useful links section</a> for some existing network datasets). In the same way, you can use already existing software tools or use your own code.

<p>You can also focus more on the analysis in itself (ex: showing insights gained), on the efficiency of the implemented algorithms (ex: showing execution times on different datasets), or on any other combination.

<p>You are strongly encouraged to speak with the professor so that you can validate your idea for the project before starting your work.

<p>Here are some example projects:

  <ul>
    <li><b>Papers Datasets:</b> Take co-authorship network or a citations network and explore it. Possible tasks: differences between different areas and/or conferences, communities, importance of scientists, consider time, ...
    <li><b>Sports Datasets:</b> Choose a sport and produce a results networks and explore it. Possible tasks: create ranking based on network, ...
    <li><b>Flights Datasets:</b> Take all flights and explore airport importance, country importance, communities, ...
    <li><b>Wikipedia Datasets:</b> Take a subset of Wikpedia and explore that subarea (ex: what is the most important article on a sub area, what communities are there, what is the difference on the network topology between different languages, ...)
    <li><b>Product Datasets:</b> Take a co-purchasing or user-buying network and analyze it. Example tasks: predict links, communities, ... 
    <li><b>Review Datasets:</b> Take an user-product review dataset (ex: movies) and analyze it. Example tasks: predict links/scores, communities of users and/or products, ...
    <li><b>Biological Datasets:</b> Take a biology network (ex: protein interaction, gene regulation, brain networks, ...) and explore it. Example tasks: discover characteristic patterns, ...
  </ul>
