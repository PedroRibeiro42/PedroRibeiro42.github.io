<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<ul>
  <li>(SI) Submitted Implementations: <b>50%</b>
  <li>(CE) Participation in Competitive Events: <b>20%</b>
  <li>(PP) Presentations and Class Participation: <b>30%</b>
</ul>

<p>Each component has a grade from 0% to 100%.

<hr>

<h2>(SI) Submitted Implementations</h2>

<p><b>See detailed grades for this evaluation item</b>

<ul>  
  <li>We plan to have 10 evaluation problem sets. Each problemset is worth 12% of the total grade (with a maximum of 100% on this evaluation component).
  <li>Each problem set will have a deadline associated with it. The typical deadline will be two weeks after the problems are made public.
  <li>Each problem set has 6 problems. The first problem solved is worth 35%, the second one 30%, the third one 20% and the fourth one 15%. This means that:
    <ul>
      <li>Solving one problem is worth 35%
      <li>Solving two problems is worth 65%
      <li>Solving three problems is worth 85%
      <li>Solving at least four problems is worth 100%
    </ul>
  <li>For each day after the delivery date you will have a 2% penalty on the respective problem. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>2 problems before the deadline and 1 problem four days after the deadline will give you 77% (65% for the first two problems and 12%=20%-4*2% for the third problem)
      <li>3 problems before the deadline and 1 problem 10 days after the deadline will give you 85% (85% for the first three problems and 0% for the last, since the penalty of 10*2% is more than than the 15% that the last problem would give you).
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>(CE) Competitive Events</h2>

<p>There will be three competitive events where it is expected that the students appear and try to submit during the designated time:
  <ul>
    <li><b>[25%] #01:</b> <i>(contest similar to a CodeForces Round)</i>
    <li><b>[25%] #02:</b> <i>(partial poins per problem)</i>
    <li><b>[50%] #03:</b> <i>(final contest, can have partial points/subtasks such as small and big testcases)</i>
  </ul>

<p>Failure to participate in at least two of these events will result in a RFC evaluation (lack of an evaluation component).</p>

<p>You can participate in extra contests (ex: Codeforces Rounds) to compensate for any contest that did not go well for you (extra participations will be evaluated on a case by case basis).<p>
  
<hr>

<h2>(PP) Presentations and Class Participation</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>[40%] (CP) Creating a Problem:</b> each student should create a new problem on the style of a competitive programming event, together with all associated material (problem statement, solution and written editorial, inputs/outputs and generator)
    <li><b>[30%] (PP)</b> <b>Presenting a Problem:</b> mandatory oral presentation of (at least) one of the student's accepted problems (selected by the professor)
    <li><b>[30%] (GE) Global Effort:</b> overall appreciation of the student overall effort on the course:
      <ul>
	<li>Quality of submitted code (including comments)
	<li>Extra problems made (above the minimum for having 100% of the SI component)
	<li>Extra contests where the students participated
	<li>Participation on classes and slack
	<li>Other relevant activities (ex: writing wiki-like articles about algorithms or data structures)
      </ul>
  </ul>
