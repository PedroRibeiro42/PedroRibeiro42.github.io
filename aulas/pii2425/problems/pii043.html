<h2>[PII043] This Is An Emergency!</h2>

<p><img src="pii043.png" align="right" width="250">
Rachel Green is facing a serious crisis—there’s a HUGE designer sale, and she HAS to get to the store before someone else buys the last perfect outfit. (<i>Priorities, people!</i>). The only problem? She’s lost. Again.</p>

<p>This mall is basically a giant maze, and she has no idea if she can even reach the store. (<i>Seriously, who designs these places?!</i>).</p>

<p>The mall layout is represented as a 2D grid where 'R' is Rachel's starting position, 'S' is the store she wants to reach, '.' is a walkable path and '#' is a wall. Rachel can move up, down, left and right (but not diagonally - she he is in heels, after all).</p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Your task is to Help Rachel figure out if there's a way to get from where she is to the store. There are several mall layouts, and for each of them you need to find if there is a path from 'R' to 'S' only using walkable cells ('.').</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>On the first line there is an integer <b>N</b> indicating the amount of cases to consider.</p>

<p>Each case starts with two numbers <b>R</b> and <b>C</b> indicating respectively the number of rows and columns of the petri dish. The <b>R</b> lines follow, each one with <b>C</b> characters, indicating the contents of each position: 'R' for the position of Rachel, 'S' for the store, '.' for a walkable path and '#' for a wall. There will always be exactly one position with 'R' and one position with 'S' in the layout of each mall.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output should have <b>N</b> lines, one for each case, containing "yes" if Rachel can reach the store and "no" if there is no possible path.</p>
  
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>N</b> &le; 20</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of test cases</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>R, C</b> &le; 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Dimensions of the matrix</td>
  </tr>  
</table>

<br>

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="black" border="0">
  <tr bgcolor="#e2e2e2">
    <td>Example Input</td>
    <td>Example Output</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="white">
    <td valign="top">
<pre>
2
5 10
..#.......
###...#...
..#...#..S
.R#...####
......#...
4 4
R..#
..#.
.#..
#..S
</pre>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
<pre>
yes
no
</pre>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>On the first case Rachel can reach all the positions in green, which include the store (hence, the answer is "yes"):</p>

<pre>
..#<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">.......</span>
###<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">...</span>#<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">...</span>
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">..</span>#<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">...</span>#<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">..S</span>
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">.R</span>#<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">...</span>####
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">......</span>#...
</pre>

On the second case Rachel can reach all the positions in green, which don't include the store (hence, the answer is "no"):

<pre>
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">R..</span>#
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">..</span>#.
<span style="background-color:#aaffaa;">.</span>#..
#..S
</pre>
