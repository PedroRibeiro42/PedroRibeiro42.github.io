<h2>[PII037] Unique Words</h2>

<p><img src="pii037.png" align="right" width="200">
  In the sun-scorched kingdom of Dorne, words are as sharp as blades, and Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper, is known for both. A master of combat and conversation, Oberyn values those who can separate truth from noise.</p>

<p>One evening, as the sun sets over Sunspear, Oberyn issues you a challenge: <i>"In battle, every move must be precise - no wasted steps. In words, only those that are unique hold power. Show me that you can count the words that matter, and perhaps I will trust you with secrets even the sands cannot bury.</i>"
  
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Given a set of words, your task is to count how many unique words exist, that is, repeated words should only be counted once.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of input contain an integer <b>N</b>, representing the number of words that follow.</p>

<p>Each of the next <b>N</b> lines contain a word <b>W</b> formed only by lowercase letters.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output should be a single line containing an integer: the number of different words that appear on the input, as explained in the problem description</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>N</b> &le; 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of words</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>|W|</b> &lt; 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Length of the words</td>
  </tr>  
</table>

<br>
