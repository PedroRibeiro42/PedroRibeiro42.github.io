<h2>[PII039] You know nothing, Jon Snow</h2>

<p><img src="pii039.png" align="right" width="200">
  Beyond the Wall, the Free Folk speak in ways as wild as the land they roam. To them, words are not fixed - they grow, change, and evolve like the living world itself. Ygritte, fierce and untamed, laughs as she sets a challenge before Jon Snow:</i>

<p><i>"You think you know our ways? You know nothing, Jon Snow. Watch as our words change - step by step, rule by rule. If you can follow their evolution, maybe youâ€™ll understand us... a little."</i></p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Your task is to compute the evolution of a word (made up of just letters 'A' and 'B') showing consecutive generations of it according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any 'A' becomes 'AB'
  <li>Any 'B' becomes 'A'
</ul>

<p>For instance, if we start with "A" and ask for 4 generations, the following happens:</p>

<pre>
n=0:               A        initial
                  / \
n=1:             A   B      the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A &rarr; AB), rule (B &rarr; A) couldn't be applied
                /|    \
n=2:           A B     A    former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A
              /| |     |\
n=3:         A B A     A B  note all A's producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...
            /| | |\   /| |
n=4:       A B A A B A B A  ... into an A one generation later, starting to repeat then
</pre>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of input contain a string <b>S</b> representing the initial word to consider (made only of letters 'A' and/or 'B').</p>

<p>The second line contains an integer <b>K</b> indicating the number of generations to compute.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output should be contain exactly <b>N</b>+1 lines: the first line contains the initial word <b>S</b> and the following <b>N</b> lines contain the next <b>N</b> generations of that word.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>|W|</b> &lt; 10</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Length of the initial word</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>K</b> &le; 10</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of generations</td>
  </tr>  
</table>

<p>You can be assured that the final generation will not have more than 10&nsbp;000 letters.</p>
