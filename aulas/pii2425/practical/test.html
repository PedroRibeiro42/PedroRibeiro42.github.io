<h3>General Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Date:</b> 30/04/2025 (wednesday)
  <li><b>Time:</b> 16:30
    <!-- <i>[the allocation of students to a particular shift and computer lab will be given after lunch on 11/11/2024]</i><br>

    <!-- [<a href="../evaluation/turnos_teste.pdf">see student allocation to shift and room</a>]  <i>(protected access)</i> -->
  <li><b>Place:</b> <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/instal_geral.espaco_view?pv_id=69108">FC6 155</a>, <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/instal_geral.espaco_view?pv_id=69045">FC6 157</a>, <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/instal_geral.espaco_view?pv_id=69183">FC6 163</a>, <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/instal_geral.espaco_view?pv_id=69064">FC6 155</a> (DCC Labs on FC 6)
  </li>
  <li><b>Duration:</b> 2h
  <li><b>Method:</b> the test will be individual and will consist of practical problems for which you can submit C code to Mooshak and receive feedback that might include public test cases, like in the practical classes
  <li><b>Language:</b> all problems will be available in english and in portuguese
  <li><b>Environment:</b> the computers will have Linux, with gcc available at the command line, and the usual editors and IDEs (we will also try to make available an online compiler - before the test we will confirm which one); you will have access to documentation (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c">cppreference</a>) and to a local copy of the course website (including the lecture slides and the practical classes pages).
    <span style="color:brown">You will also have access to a text file you can pre-submit on Mooshak (until 23:59 of April 29th), which might include anything you want, such as code you submitted during classes.</span>
  <li><b>Scoring:</b> this test is worth 8 points out of 20 (40% of your class grade) [see <a href="../evaluation.html#grades">explanation and calculation formula of final grade</a>]<br>
    You will have 7 small exercises in Mooshak worth 22%+21%+20%+15%+13%+7%+2%.
    In each exercise there might be <b>partial scoring</b> (e.g. passes some tests, fails on others).<br>
    When submitting, you will know the score you got on all tests. Your grade on a problem will be the grade of your best submission on that problem (the one with the highest score), and you can submit as many times as you want.<br>
