  <h1>Help about Mooshak</h1>

<h3>What is possible to on Mooshak?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Send a proposal of a solution (a submission) in the form of code, receiving an automated answer.
  <li>See problem statements.
  <li>ASk questions (on this course questions should be made on Discord and not on Mooshak)
  <li>See all made submissions, submitted code and detailed results of each submission.
  <li>See the rankings for each class volume of problems.
  <li>See help about the system.
</ul>

<hr>
  
<h3>How to submit code?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create a file with the extension <tt>.c</tt>
  <li>Make the code to solve the problem &#128513;
  <li>Don't forget compile, execute and test the code on your computer
  <li>Using the interface, choose the file 
  (<i>Browse</i>) and send it (<i>Submit</i>)
  <li>All data should be read from the standard input and should be written to the standard output
  <li>All lines in the input and output should be terminated with a newline character
</ul>

<h3>What to the automated answers given by Mooshak mean?</h3>

  <p>At this course you will be able to see for each submission a detailed table containing the result for each test case on which your program was tested (you can access it by clicking on the result of the submission on listing). Some of the tests are public, meaning that if you fail them you will be able to see what was the input and the expected output).</p>

    <th><b>Answer</b></th>
    <th><b>Meaning</b></th>

  <td><span style="color:darkgreen"><b>Accepted</b></span></td>
