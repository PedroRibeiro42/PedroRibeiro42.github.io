<h2>[PII018] Collatz Sequence</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/710/"><img border="0" src="pii018.png" align="right" width="300"></a>
    The Collatz sequence, also known as the <i>3n + 1</i> sequence, is a mathematical sequence defined for positive integers. The sequence starts with any positive integer <i>n</i> and follows these rules:

<ul>
  <li>If <i>n</i> is even, the next term is <i>n/2</i></li>
  <li>If <i>n</i> is odd, the next term is <i>3n + 1</i></li>
  <li>The sequence ends when it reaches <i>1</i></li>
</ul>

  <p>Despite its simplicity, the Collatz conjecture, which says that this sequence will always eventually reach 1 for any positive integer <i>n</i>, remains unproven. This intriguing problem invites exploration of the patterns and behaviors of numbers as they traverse through the sequence.</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a program that, given several integers, generates the Collatz sequence that starts from each of them.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, representing the number of test cases that follow.</p>

<p>Each of the following <b>T</b> lines contains one integer <b>N</b>, representing the number that we want to start the Collatz sequence from.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output should have exactly <b>T</b> output lines, one per input test case.</p>

<p>Each of these lines should contain the respective sequence, starting from <b>N</b>. Numbers in the sequence should be separated by a comma and a space (see the format depicted in the example output).</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>T</b> &le; 10</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of test cases</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>1 &le; <b>N</b> &le; 10<sup>5</sup></td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Starting number of the sequence</td>
  </tr>
</table>
